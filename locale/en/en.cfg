; Remaking electrophage tech from Biochemistry mod.
electrophages=Electrophage cultivation
; Battery stuff
battery=Batteries
holmium-battery=Holmium batteries
; Fulgorite farming
fulgorite-farming=Fulgorite farming

[technology-description]
; Remaking electrophage tech from Biochemistry mod.
electrophages=Even in the lightning-blasted ruins of Fulgora, life can still be found. With proper care, a starter culture of electrophages can be cultivated for a self-sustaining supply of nutrients, enabling local bio-industry.
; Holmium battery tech
holmium-battery=With holmium, you can make batteries that last forever and hold more energy. Unlike regular batteries, their charge will never spoil, and they are never destroyed by charging.
; For battery tech, we're adding chargers and dischargers.
battery=Batteries can be charged and discharged, allowing energy to be transported or saved for later.
; Fulgorite farming
fulgorite-farming=Fulgorites are coral-like structures formed by colonies of electrophages in symbiosis with a native crystalline fungus. They can be cultivated to produce holmium renewably.

[entity-name]
; Battery chargers and dischargers, based on Battery Powered mod.

; Remaking electrophages from the Biochemistry mod.
electrophage=Electrophage
; New charged batteries etc, based on Battery Powered mod.
charged-battery=Charged battery
holmium-battery=Holmium battery
charged-holmium-battery=Charged holmium battery
battery-charger=Battery charger
battery-discharger=Battery-powered generator
; Renaming holmium ore to holmium powder, and creating fulgorite shards.
holmium-ore=Holmium powder
fulgorite-shard=Fulgorite shard
fulgorite-starter=Fulgorite starter
polysalt=Polysalts

[item-description]
polysalt=Long-lasting nutrients derived from Fulgoran microbes.
fulgorite-starter=Used by agricultural towers to grow fulgorites. When harvested, yields fulgorite shards, which must be processed into more starters before they can be planted again.
; For battery discharger, note that it has low priority.
battery-discharger=Releases energy by discharging batteries. Only operates when available electricity from primary sources (such as steam engines and lightning rods) is insufficient to meet demand.

holmium-ore=Fulgorite crushing

[fluid-name]
; Sludge from Fulgoran Sludge mod.
fulgoran-sludge=Sludge

[fuel-category-name]
; Battery category for discharging batteries.
battery=Battery

[mod-setting-name]
FulgoraLives-remove-accumulators=Remove accumulators

[mod-setting-description]
FulgoraLives-remove-accumulators=If enabled, accumulators will be impossible to craft and removed from all recipes and techs, leaving battery chargers and dischargers as your only option. This makes power management much harder on Fulgora and anywhere you use solar power.

[tile-name]
; Rename tiles from "oil" to "sludge".
oil-ocean-shallow=Sludge ocean
oil-ocean-deep=Deep sludge ocean
